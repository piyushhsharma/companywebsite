npm run eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t revert your changes!

This command allows you to have full control over your app's build and configuration. It copies all the configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project.

You don’t need to eject if the default setup works for you. However, if you need deep customization, eject gives you flexibility.
